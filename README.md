###Equipment: Google Cardboard, Android phone (tested)
###Gameplay Instructions:
####1. Tilt head to direct the leaf through the can barricades
####2. Make sounds (or simply shout) to interact with possible crashes
####3. The alpha version where cans are sometimes missing (cuz they were designed by line not plane) could be confusing...

#####//Note: Unzip the file and use Unity to build it as Android format
